## 🧩 Database Design

| Entity     | Key Fields                                      | Relationships |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **User**   | `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`        | A user can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings. |
| **Property** | `id`, `title`, `description`, `price`, `host_id` | A property belongs to a user (host) and can have many bookings and reviews. |
| **Booking** | `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out` | A booking is made by a user for a specific property. |
| **Review** | `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment` | A review is written by a user for a property. |
| **Payment** | `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `timestamp` | A payment is associated with a specific booking. |

## ⚙️ Feature Breakdown

### 🔐 User Management  
Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. This feature ensures secure access and personalizes user experience for guests and hosts.

### 🏠 Property Management  
Allows hosts to list, update, and remove properties. It includes essential details such as title, description, price, and location to make listings discoverable and bookable.

### 📅 Booking System  
Enables guests to reserve properties, select dates, and manage their reservations. Hosts can view and manage incoming bookings.

### 💳 Payment Processing  
Securely processes user payments for bookings. This includes integrating with a payment provider, tracking payment status, and logging transaction history.

### ⭐ Review System  
Allows users to rate and review properties after their stay. This builds trust in the platform and helps future users make informed decisions.

## 🔐 API Security

- **Authentication:** Ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
- **Authorization:** Verifies that users can only access or modify data they own (e.g., only hosts can update their listings).
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse of endpoints by limiting how frequently users can make requests.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Protects the API from injection and malformed requests.

**Why It Matters:** Securing APIs is critical to protect user data, ensure secure payments, and prevent unauthorized access to system features.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

**CI/CD** (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) is a workflow automation method to:

- Automatically test code when changes are pushed.
- Build and deploy code seamlessly to staging or production environments.

### Tools Used:
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing and deployment on each code push or pull request.
- **Docker:** Ensures consistency across development, staging, and production through containerization.
- **Optional:** Tools like Travis CI, Jenkins, or CircleCI can also be integrated.
